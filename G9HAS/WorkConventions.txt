Each one creates its own GUI along with an appropriate controller.

There is no controller that unifies some gui s.

Send to server sendtoserver (HashMap <String, Object> params)
The HashMap will always have parameters <String, Object>
Each line of the HashMap will always have String = "actionName" and the second field will be Object = parameter


for example:
add subject:  <"addSubject","Java">
params.put("addSubject","Java");
params.put("addStudent",student1);

switch(act){
	case "addSubject":
	break;
}

actions by name:
